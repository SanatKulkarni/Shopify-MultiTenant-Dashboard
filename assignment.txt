Scope of Work
✅ 1. Shopify Store Setup
● Create a free Shopify development store.
● Add dummy products, customers, and orders to it.

✅ 2. Data Ingestion Service
● Build a service that connects to Shopify APIs (Or other way round where your APIs are
hit by Shopify) and ingests:
○ Customers
○ Orders
○ Products
○ (Bonus) Custom events like cart abandoned, checkout started

● Store this data into your database (Use any RDBMS here as we’d ask SQL questions on
this during interviews)
● Ensure the service can be configured for multiple tenants (stores), with data isolated
using a tenant identifier.
